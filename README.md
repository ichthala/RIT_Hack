RIT_Hack
========

Welcome to the world of code!

This repository has 4 branches, each containing a different step on the path toward setting up a basic Rails app. You can find directions for getting to the next step in the readme file on each branch.

The structure is as follows:
- master: An empty repository without a rails app
- generate_app: A brand new rails app with no models, views or controllers
- first_scaffold: A rails app with the first model(user) scaffolded, but no additional models

# master - How to generate your Rails application
Within your Nitrous terminal type the following commands:
- cd workspace
- rails new RIT_Hack
